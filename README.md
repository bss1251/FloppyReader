# FloppyReader - A floppy disk image reader written in Angular Dart

Wasn't Angular Dart designed for low-level file system access?
<br />
<br />


To run: after cloning the repo, in the root directory execute `pub get` followed by `webdev serve`.
<br />
Navigate to `localhost:8080` and load a FAT 12 floppy disk image to see its contents.
<br />
<br />
Previews will be provided for text files and all files can be downloaded (extracted) from the image by clicking on file, then clicking on the floppy disk icon in the bottom right of the panel.
